Project Overview-
This project focuses on building a lead scoring model for X Education, an online education company. The goal is to identify hot leads—potential customers who are most likely to convert—so that the sales team can focus on them, improving conversion rates from 30% to 80%.
We use logistic regression to assign a lead score to each prospect based on their behavior and interactions on the website.

Dataset-
The dataset consists of around 9000 leads with various features, such as:
Lead Source (where the lead came from)
Total Time Spent on Website
Last Activity (e.g., email opened, form submitted)
Lead Origin (Organic Search, Referral, etc.)
Converted (Target variable: 1 = converted, 0 = not converted)
The dataset also includes categorical variables with levels such as "Select", which are treated as missing values.

Goals of the Case Study-
Build a logistic regression model to assign lead scores between 0 and 100.
Analyze factors influencing conversion rates and suggest actionable insights.
Optimize the lead conversion funnel to help the sales team prioritize high-quality leads.
Present findings in business terms for stakeholders.
